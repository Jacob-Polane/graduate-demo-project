# Debugging Assignment

## Overview
Welcome to the debugging exercise! Your task is to go through the provided HTML file, identify and fix the issues based on the comments, and track your progress using GitHub Project.

## Instructions

1. Clone the repository containing the buggy HTML file.
2. Open the file in a text editor and start resolving the issues one by one.
3. For each issue you resolve:
   - Check if an issue already exists on GitHub.
   - If it does not exist, create a new issue describing the problem and your fix.
   - Assign the issue to yourself.
   - Commit your fix with a message that references the issue number.
   - Push your changes to the repository.
4. Repeat until all issues are resolved.

## Guidelines

- Resolve one issue at a time to maintain clarity in commits.
- Ensure proper HTML, CSS, and JavaScript best practices are followed.
- Test your fixes in a web browser to confirm they work correctly.

## Setting Up Live Server

To see your changes in real-time, install the **Live Server** extension in Visual Studio Code:

1. Open **Visual Studio Code**.
2. Go to the **Extensions Marketplace** by clicking on the Extensions icon in the sidebar or pressing `Ctrl + Shift + X`.
3. Search for **Live Server**.
4. Click **Install**.
5. Once installed, open the buggy HTML file and right-click anywhere in the editor.
6. Select **Open with Live Server**.
7. Your browser will open, and any changes you make will be automatically reloaded.


Happy debugging! ðŸš€
